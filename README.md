# Project: Distance Mapping Using Tensor Operations

This project aims to implement a function that takes a sparse list of 2D coordinates and maps them to a 2D tensor of a specified resolution. The values of each pixel in the tensor correspond to the Euclidean distance between that pixel and the closest pixel containing a data point. The project supports batch processing and leverages PyTorch for tensor operations.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a Python environment, install necessary libraries, and implement a function that maps 2D coordinates to a 2D tensor of specified resolution. The values of each pixel in the tensor represent the Euclidean distance to the closest data point. The project supports batch processing, allowing multiple sets of coordinates to be processed simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu or a compatible Linux distribution
- Python 3.10 or higher

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Virtual Environment

To isolate the project dependencies, we will use Python's virtual environment tool.

```bash
!apt install python3.10-venv
```

This command installs the Python 3.10 virtual environment package on your system.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment named `myenv`.

```bash
!python -m venv myenv
```

The venv module creates a virtual environment named `myenv` in your current directory.

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the newly created virtual environment.

```bash
!source myenv/bin/activate
```

This command activates the virtual environment, which isolates your project’s dependencies from your system’s Python environment.

### 4. Upgrade pip

Ensure you have the latest version of pip.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

This command upgrades pip to the latest version available.

### 5. Install Required Packages

Install specific versions of the required packages.

```bash
!pip install torch numpy matplotlib pandas
```

These commands install the specified versions of torch, numpy, matplotlib, and pandas.

## Usage

### 1. Import Libraries

Import the necessary libraries for your project.

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

### 2. Define and Implement Functions

#### Create Points Function

This function generates random points within the unit square.

```python
def create_points(batch_size, num_points):
    points = torch.rand(batch_size, num_points, 2)
    points = torch.cat((points, torch.zeros(batch_size, num_points, 1)), dim=-1)
    return points
```

#### Minimum Distance Function

This function calculates the minimum Euclidean distance from each pixel to the closest data point.

```python
def min_dist(points, resolution):
    points = torch.tensor(points)
    grid_x, grid_y = torch.meshgrid(torch.linspace(0, 1, resolution), torch.linspace(0, 1, resolution))
    grid = torch.stack([grid_x, grid_y], dim=-1).unsqueeze(0).repeat(points.shape[0], 1, 1, 1)
    distances = torch.cdist(grid.view(points.shape[0], -1, 2), points[..., :2])
    min_distances, _ = torch.min(distances, dim=-1)
    min_distances = min_distances.view(points.shape[0], resolution, resolution)
    return min_distances
```

### 3. Run Example

#### Testing the Function

```python
batch_size = 3
num_points = 4
points = create_points(batch_size, num_points)
res = 25
distances = min_dist(points, res)
print(distances.shape)
```

#### Visualize Results

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(batch_size, 1, figsize=(6, 6))
for i in range(batch_size):
    axs[i].imshow(distances[i], cmap='viridis')
    axs[i].set_title(f'Distance Map - Batch {i+1}')
    axs[i].axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
