# GAN with TensorFlow on CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The GAN comprises a generator and a discriminator model that are trained together to generate realistic images.

## Introduction

This project uses a GAN to generate images similar to those in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the GAN project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gan-cifar10.git
   cd gan-cifar10
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

### Training the GAN

To train the GAN, run the following script:
```sh
python train_gan.py
```

The script will train the GAN on the CIFAR-10 dataset for the specified number of epochs and batch size. Training progress, including discriminator and generator losses, will be printed to the console.

### Generating Images

To generate images using the trained generator, run the following script:
```sh
python generate_images.py
```

The script generates images from random noise vectors and displays them using Matplotlib.

## Model Architecture

### Generator

The generator model is composed of fully connected layers with LeakyReLU activation functions. It produces images with values in the range [-1, 1] using a tanh activation function.

### Discriminator

The discriminator model consists of fully connected layers with LeakyReLU activation functions and Dropout layers for regularization. The final layer outputs a probability score using a sigmoid activation function.

## Training

The training process involves alternating between training the discriminator and the generator to improve their respective performances. The CIFAR-10 images are normalized to the range [-1, 1] before training.

## Generating Images

After training, the GAN can generate images by providing random noise vectors as input to the generator. The generated images are scaled back to the range [0, 1] for visualization.

## Results

The generated images can be visualized using Matplotlib. Below is an example of two generated images from different noise vectors:
